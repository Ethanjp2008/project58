                <p>Football is my favourite hobby. It’s a team
sport, in which you can score only by placing
the ball inside the goal of the opposite team.
Teams content 11 players – field players and a
goalkeeper. The goalkeeper’s role is to protect
the goal. He’s the only person that can touch
the ball with his hands, but only in his penalty
area. There are also 3 men which are not
playing, these are the refferees.
• Personally I play football for both training and
fun.</p>
